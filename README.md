# Sentimental-Analysis-of-Metaverse-Tweets
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on tweets related to the metaverse using machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The metaverse is an emerging concept that encompasses virtual and augmented reality environments, and understanding public sentiment towards it is crucial for various stakeholders, including investors, developers, and policymakers.

The project utilizes a dataset consisting of tweets collected from Kaggle, focusing on topics related to the metaverse. It employs a combination of ML and NLP models to classify the sentiment of each tweet as positive, negative, or neutral. The sentiment analysis helps in gauging the overall public perception and sentiment trends towards the metaverse.
